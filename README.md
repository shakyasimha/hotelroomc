# hotelroomc
A simple, yet chaotic program written in C.

This was a first semester project, written back in 2019, within two days, because we were in a hurry to finish the project.
This is just the source code, and it doesn't work as expected, hence the "chaotic" project.

<I swear to God, I hate myself for deleteing the original documentation.>
